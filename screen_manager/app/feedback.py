"""Does this screen work as you expect? One answer per physical board, shared with the Tessera website (app 0.3.10).

The owner answers a short question on the screen's page in ESP Screens: yes, or not quite with what goes wrong. Only an
explicit answer leaves the app, and only this: the board's model (its key in boards.yaml, the same key the website uses),
the answer, the chosen problems, an optional note, and the firmware and app versions. Nothing about Home Assistant, the
screen's name, its entities or its logs.

Each board gets its own random key (secrets.token_hex(32)) the first time its owner shares an answer. The key is kept
here, in the app's private data, under the board's Home Assistant device id, and goes out only as the Bearer of a request
to the website: it is not a hash of anything, the device id itself never leaves, and two boards of one model get two
keys. The website keeps one latest answer per key; a changed answer is a higher revision of the same answer, and the
same revision with the same content is safe to send again, so a retry after a timeout never counts twice.

The answer, its revision and a new key are written to disk before the first request goes out. Requests for one board go
one at a time (a lock per board); a request that failed on the network is tried again after 1 minute, 5 minutes,
30 minutes and 6 hours (honouring Retry-After), and after 24 hours the app stops and offers to send it again by hand.
Deleting first stops those retries and waits for a request that is under way, so a late one cannot bring the deleted
answer back. Nothing is ever sent on a schedule of its own: no heartbeat, no daily report, nothing when the card shows.

Storage: feedback.json next to screens.json, version 1, readable only by the app. A file with another version is left
exactly as it is and the feature stays off until an app that knows it reads it.
